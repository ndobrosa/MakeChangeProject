### Week One homework for Skill Distillery

#### Overview
At first, a cash register operator is prompted to enter the price of a product. The program then prompts the operator to enter whether they would like to add another product to the receipt. If the cashier's answer is is not negative ('N'), they are prompted to enter the second product's price. The operator is then urged to enter the amount tendered by the customer.
If the amount tendered is higher than the total price, the program prints the number of bills and coins they should return to the customer.
If the amount tendered is lower than the total price, the operator is prompted to choose between canceling the transaction and entering a new tendered value. If they cancel the transaction, the program prompts the operator to return the tendered amount to the customer. Otherwise, the operator can enter a new tendered value.
Finally, If the amount tendered is equal to the price, the operator is informed that the full amount has been paid.
